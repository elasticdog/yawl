                       Installation Instructions

Examine the Makefile, and modify it if necessary (it will likely work
as is.


To build and install everything (the word list, utilities, and man pages):
   make
   make install (as root)


To install only the word list:
   make install_list (as root)


Note: The word list installs into /usr/share/dict. Most standard Linux
distributions already have this directory.
